Here are my vim settings, which I drop into my home folder
These are mostly from Adam Wolff, my long time ago vim mentor with some modifications over the years
I use MacVim, which I love (gvim on Windows, which is also quite good)
in my .bashrc, I have:
alias vim=/Applications/MacVim-7_2-stable-1_2/mvim
alias vi=vim

I used to use vim settings for bash (set -o vi), but it kills people when I'm pairing, so I've removed it

Feel free to borrow any of these settings if they help you.
